# ReactQuiz

ReactQuiz was a another test of my understanding of React hooks and state management. The overall concept of this project is simple and sweet but from my code you can see that I attempted to write code to prioritize performance. 

# Project  

There are 5 questions with 4 possible answers - the order of the answers are randomized to hide the fact that the first 'answer' in the answers array is the correct answer. I've incorporated a progress bar to express the remaining time as each question is limited to 10 seconds per answer. If you decide to not answer, or skip, it will count as a skip at the end of the quiz. Once you pick an answer, the answer will highlight yellow to indicate the answer it locked in. After a couple seconds, the selected answer will illuminate green or red to indicate right or wrong. 

The Summary Section

At the end of the quiz, you will be able to see a summary of the quiz - percentage of questions skipped, answered correctly, and answered incorrectly. You will also see each question re-iterated below with the selected answer. 

# How to run

If you'd like to test out my code for yourself, 

simply run, npm install

and because I'm using Vite,

npm run dev
